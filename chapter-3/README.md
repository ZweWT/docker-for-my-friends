#### Now let's take a closer look at Docker components. 

Before we start to look at Docker components. Let's learn about what actually is a container.

### 3.1 What is a Linux container 

As I mentioned before, in earlier years, Docker directly uses [Linux containers (LXC)](https://linuxcontainers.org/) as its runtime and then later dropped it.    
 So, let's take a look at LXC before.

![LXC architecture](https://www.baeldung.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/11/Linux-Container-Architecture-1.jpg)

  _Figure 3.1.1 LXC architecture_


A Linux container, at its core, is made up of; 
- Namespaces
- Cgroups (Control groups) 
- Other Kernel capabilities 

#### Namespaces

- Namespaces tell processes **what they can see**.
 
Namespaces is a Linux kernel feature that carry out the distinction between kernel resources.
Examples of resources are process IDs, hostnames, files, usernames, network access names, UNIX time sharing (UTS) and inter-process communications (IPC). 
Any individual process can only view or use the namespace associated with that particular process.

On Linux, you can check your system's namespace by following command:
        
        lsns

example output:
````
        NS TYPE   NPROCS   PID USER          COMMAND
4026531835 cgroup    110  2032 htetpainghtun /lib/systemd/systemd --user
4026531836 pid       108  2032 htetpainghtun /lib/systemd/systemd --user
4026531837 user       88  2032 htetpainghtun /lib/systemd/systemd --user
4026531838 uts       110  2032 htetpainghtun /lib/systemd/systemd --user
4026531839 ipc        90  2032 htetpainghtun /lib/systemd/systemd --user
4026531840 mnt       109  2032 htetpainghtun /lib/systemd/systemd --user
4026532008 net        89  2032 htetpainghtun /lib/systemd/systemd --user
````
_Following outputs are parent namespaces started when booting with systemd._

#### Cgroups (Control Groups)

- Cgroups tell processes **what they can use**.

Cgroups is a Linux kernel feature that limits, accounts for, and isolates the resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network, etc.) of a collection of processes.
One of the design goals of cgroups is to provide a unified interface to many different use cases, from controlling single processes 
(by using nice, for example) to full operating system-level virtualization (as provided by OpenVZ, Linux-VServer or LXC, for example). 

Cgroups provides:
- Resource limiting
    - groups can be set to not exceed a configured memory limit
- Prioritization
    - some groups may get a larger share of CPU utilization or disk I/O throughput
- Accounting
    - measures a group's resource usage
- Control
    - freezing groups of processes, their checkpointing and restarting

On Linux system with systemd, you can check your system's namespace by following command:

    systemd-cgls 

Outputs may look like this:
````
├─system
│ ├─1 /usr/lib/systemd/systemd --switched-root --system --deserialize 20  
│ ...
│      
├─user
│ ├─user-1000
│ │ └─ ...
│ 
│ └─1 /sbin/init splash
└─system.slice 
  ├─irqbalance.service 
  │ └─911 /usr/sbin/irqbalance --foreground
  ├─containerd.service 
  │ └─1008 /usr/bin/containerd
  ├─systemd-udevd.service 
  │ └─334 /lib/systemd/systemd-udevd
  ├─cron.service 
  │ └─899 /usr/sbin/cron -f
  ├─thermald.service 
  │ └─936 /usr/sbin/thermald --systemd --dbus-enable --adaptive
  ├─docker.service 
  │ └─1549 /usr/bin/dockerd -H fd:// --containerd=/run/containerd/containerd.sock
  ├─ssh.service 
  │ └─1032 sshd: /usr/sbin/sshd -D [listener] 0 of 10-100 startups
  ...

*If you want to learn more about Cgroups Redhat has
[documentation on how to manage resources on RHEL7 Linux](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/resource_management_guide/index)
(but the concept is same for Linux distros).*

I also recommend this [super cool video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sK5i-N34im8) (54mins) from Jérôme Petazzoni @PyCon 2016 

which explains Namespaces and Cgroups and demonstration on to make a bare minimum linux container from scratch.

[This one "Building a container from scratch in Go"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Utf-A4rODH8) (20mins) is from Liz Rice 
where she demonstrated a bare container from scratch with GoLang.
