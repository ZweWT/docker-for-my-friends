Teaching docker to my friends. (:

Hello this is "INTRODUCTION TO DOCKER FOR MY FRIENDS". :) 
This is my take on docker after learning containerization technology for a year so I may not be very experienced and "all knowing" around docker but hey, here's my 8 cents for those people like me who wants to learn docker from absolute beginner perspective. :)
Also I will add some additional information about best practices, my own practices and things to aware while getting started (as I learn throught) for using docker to its potential.
This course will cover all you need to know and all you might want to know as a complete stranger to containerizationtechnology and yeah, of course, Docker.
Enjoy.. 

In this course, we will learn:
Overview of Containerization technologies and the evolution of software virtaulization.
Architecture and concepts of Docker.
Installing docker.
How to build,run and maintain images and containers.
Running multi-containers with Docker-compose. 
Hands-on examples and best practices.
What's next..
